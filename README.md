# My Portfolio

Hey there, I just made my own website where I put all my work and skills for everyone to see. It's an ideal way to show off what I can do and connect with people who are into the same stuff as me.

If you want to learn more about me and what I'm up to, go ahead and check out my website. And if you want to get in touch, hit me up on [LinkedIn](nkedin.com/in/ritesh-sharma-rk40/).
